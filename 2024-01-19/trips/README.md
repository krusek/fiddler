Three siblings are at a playground: Alice, Bob, and Carey. Alice, the oldest, gets a call from their dad—their pancake dinner is ready! But they won’t get to eat until all three kids are home.

They each walk home at a different constant speed. Alice can walk home in 10 minutes, Bob can do it in 20, and Carey in 30. Fortunately, any of the kids can carry any of the others on their back without reducing their own walking speed. (However, none of them can carry a kid who is, in turn, carrying another kid.) Assume that they can pick someone up, set someone down, and change direction instantaneously.

What is the fastest they can all get home? (Your answer should be in minutes.)

Extra credit adds an extra kid who can do it in 40.

These solve what percentage of the distance each person does.
